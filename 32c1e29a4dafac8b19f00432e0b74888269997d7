So may actually need to do nothing downstream for this.  Forgive my ignorance, but is there a way we can just skip this change for RDO?\n\n[0] https://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos9-master/component/cinder/fb/61/fb6178197fe75369026a21fbce92a384eaf97944_2d675940/mock.log",

      "message": "Hi Brian, thanks for checking.\n\nYou are looking at the right place, the problem is that dnf can not resolve the new Build requirement added automatically based on test-requirements.txt. However the actual problem is that tooz is not providing a subpackage for the etcd3gw extra https://docs.fedoraproject.org/en-US/packaging-guidelines/Python/#Extras .\n\nWe have two options:\n\n1. Adding the extra to tooz using %pyproject_extras_subpkg macro in tooz spec.\n2. excluding tooz[etcd3gw] from the automatic dependencies using exclude_brs macron in cinderlib spec https://github.com/rdo-packages/cinderlib-distgit/blob/rpm-master/python-cinderlib.spec#L8\n\nIn this case, I\u0027ll send a patch for 1 so that we provide that extra in case some other package requires it.",
