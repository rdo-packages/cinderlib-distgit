      "message": "I\u0027m not sure I\u0027m looking in the right place, but in mock.log [0], I see this:\n\nDEBUG: No matching package to install: \u0027python3dist(tooz[etcd3gw]) \u003e\u003d 2.8\u0027\n\nwhich makes me wonder if the tooling doesn\u0027t understand the \"extras\" part of the python requirement?\n\nI added tooz[etcd3gw] to cinderlib\u0027s test-requirements.txt upstream because we started getting ModuleNotFound errors for etcd3gw from tooz when running one of the *cinder* CI jobs that includes the cinderlib functional tests after it runs a bunch of tempest tests.  So may actually need to do nothing downstream for this.  Forgive my ignorance, but is there a way we can just skip this change for RDO?\n\n[0] https://trunk.rdoproject.org/centos9-master/component/cinder/fb/61/fb6178197fe75369026a21fbce92a384eaf97944_2d675940/mock.log",
